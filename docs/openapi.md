## Generate OpenAPI specification

The OpenAPI spec for the `kms-server` can be generated by running the following `make` target from the project root directory:

```sh
$ make open-api-spec
```

The generated spec can be found under `./test/bdd/fixtures/specs/openAPI.yml`.

Start the OpenAPI demo by running the following `make` target:
